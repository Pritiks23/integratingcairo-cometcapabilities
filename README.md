# integratingcairo-cometcapabilities

Below are revised versions of your agent.py and search.py files. The agent now acts as a deeply integrated AI orchestrator, much like Perplexity's Comet and similar MCP servers. It can autonomously select and use tools connected to a wide variety of APIs and web resources—covering payments (Stripe), email (Gmail/SMTP), calendar, news aggregation, mapping (Google Maps), and extensible web app actions in a centralized environment. It maintains memory, manages action permissions, and provides full autonomy within set guardrails. You can further expand the tools directory with additional connectors for any other cloud service or API.


Whats different and why: 
Agent Capabilities Now Include
Centralized Action Routing: The agent can autonomously decide which tool to use for any request: search, payments, email, calendar, news aggregation, mapping, or custom web app actions.

Integration-First Design: By importing and registering all integration and orchestration tools within the same agent, the platform can coordinate complex cross-domain tasks from a unified interface.

Proactive Planning & Logging: Every significant action is explained to the user/human for transparency and compliance review.

Expandable Tooling: Add any new API connector as a tool under .tools.* and register it—you can now tie in new SaaS, database, or system actions easily.

Enforced Safety/Guardrails: All actions pass through a policy layer that can block/modify unsafe or unwanted behaviors, keeping the agent within organizational or ethical limits.

Search Improvements
Flexible Query Filters: Easily constrain search to specific sites or content types, and add more result filtering without needing to rewrite function logic.

Standardized Result Output: Score and source for easier downstream ranking/reranking.

Structured for Multi-Use: The agent can use internet_search in a modular fashion as an API for itself or other tools.
